# flicker
A lightweight RF geolocation obfuscation tool for OpenWrt. Flicker makes your wireless device a moving target for trackers by rapidly and randomly changing its TX power and MAC-layer timing parameters, degrading/obfuscating the accuracy of RSSI-based surveillance/detectors. Not making it IMPOSSIBLE, just alot more challenging.
