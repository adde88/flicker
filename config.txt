Of course. Based on the analysis of how Flicker works and the goal of balancing potent obfuscation with stable performance, here are the recommended values for your config.txt file.

This configuration is designed to be a powerful "set and forget" profile that provides significant protection without making your wireless operations unreliable.

Recommended config.txt
# Optimal configuration for Flicker, balancing obfuscation and performance.

# The wireless interface to use if none is specified on the command line.
# CHANGE THIS to match your primary interface (e.g., wlan1, wlan2).
DEFAULT_IFACE="wlan0"

# The minimum TX power to set, in dBm.
# This provides a large power fluctuation range without dropping the signal too low.
MIN_TX_POWER_DBM=10

# The base sleep duration in seconds.
# A shorter interval to change parameters more frequently, confusing trackers.
BASE_SLEEP_SEC=7

# The maximum percentage of variation for the sleep timer.
# A high variation makes the timing of changes highly unpredictable.
SLEEP_VARIATION_PERCENT=50

# Enable Advanced Obfuscation mode (randomizes Coverage Class).
# This should be enabled for maximum effect.
ADVANCED_MODE=1

# The maximum Coverage Class to use in Advanced mode.
# Provides significant timing jitter without using extreme, potentially unstable values.
MAX_COVERAGE_CLASS=10
